# Rex

To compile: ant compile jar

To run: java -jar Rex.jar

Current Issues:

-Highly inefficient
-Requires more whitespace than python somehow
-Can only do basic math. Supported operators: ()+-*/%
-Probably will break in horrible and unexpected ways since there's little to no error handling
-I have no idea what I'm doing
