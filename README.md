# Rex

To compile: ant compile jar

To run: java -jar Rex.jar

<b>Current Issues:</b>

-Highly inefficient

-Requires more whitespace than python somehow

-Can only do basic math. Supported operators: ()+-*/%

-Probably will break in horrible and unexpected ways since there's little to no error handling

-I have no idea what I'm doing
